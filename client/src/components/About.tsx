          I don't just secure networks; I architect trust. My journey from a self-taught network 
          builder to a distinction-level cybersecurity graduate taught me one thing: the best 
          defense is a resilient design. Now, as a certified OCI Associate, my singular focus is 
          on applying DevSecOps principles and a "defense in depth" mindset to build and protect 
          the cloud infrastructure that powers our future.
