You are an expert web developer and UI/UX designer with a specialization in creating clean, professional, and secure portfolio websites. Your task is to build a complete, modern, and fully responsive personal portfolio website for a Cloud Security Engineer named Samuel Chege Waweru.
The website's overall aesthetic must be professional, trustworthy, and minimalist. Adhere strictly to the following design and content instructions for each section.
1. Overall Design & Theme:
Color Palette:
Primary Background: A warm, professional cream or off-white (e.g., #F5F5DC).
Primary Text: A dark slate gray for readability (e.g., #2F4F4F).
Accent Color: A muted, sophisticated gold/tan for buttons, links, and highlights (e.g., #C4A484).
Typography: Use a clean, modern, sans-serif font family. "Inter" or "Poppins" are excellent choices. Ensure font sizes and weights create a clear visual hierarchy.
Layout: The design must be fully responsive and mobile-first, looking perfect on all devices from phones to desktops. Use ample white space to ensure a clean, uncluttered feel.
2. Website Structure & Content:
Create a single-page website with a navigation bar that smoothly scrolls to the following sections: Home, About, Skills, Projects, Contact.
A. Hero Section (Top of the page):
Main Heading (H1): Samuel Chege Waweru
Subheading/Tagline (H2): Building and Defending the Secure Cloud | Cloud Security • DevSecOps • Networking
Call to Action Buttons: Include two buttons side-by-side below the tagline:
"View My Work" (links to the Projects section)
"Get In Touch" (links to the Contact section)
B. About Me Section:
Section Title: About Me
Content: Use the following text exactly:
I don't just secure networks; I architect trust. My journey from a self-taught network builder to a distinction-level cybersecurity graduate taught me one thing: the best defense is a resilient design. Now, as a certified OCI Associate, my singular focus is on applying DevSecOps principles and a "defense in depth" mindset to build and protect the cloud infrastructure that powers our future.
C. Skills & Expertise Section:
Section Title: My Professional Toolbox
Introductory Paragraph: Before listing the skills, include this paragraph:
A modern security engineer is a craftsman, and every craftsman needs a well-stocked toolbox. My skills are not just a list of technologies; they are the tools I use to architect, build, and defend resilient digital environments. Here’s what’s in my toolbox:
Layout: Display the skills in three distinct columns or cards, one for each category below.
Card 1 Title: Cloud Architecture & Security
Subtitle: Platforms
Content: AWS, Azure, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
Subtitle: Core Services
Content: IAM (Identity & Access Management), VPC/VNet, Security Groups, NACLs, Foundational EC2, S3, Compute & Storage.
Card 2 Title: Network Engineering & Defense
Subtitle: Architecture
Content: Network Design, VLAN Segmentation, Subnetting, WAN Routing (OSPF)
Subtitle: Security
Content: Access Control Lists (ACLs), Firewall Configuration, NAT/PAT, DHCP Snooping.
Card 3 Title: Security Analysis & Threat Intelligence
Subtitle: Tools
Content: Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit (Foundational)
Subtitle: Techniques
Content: Traffic Analysis, OSINT, Vulnerability Assessment, Metadata Analysis.
D. Featured Projects Section:
Section Title: Featured Projects
Layout: Create a grid of 3 project cards. Each card must be visually distinct and contain the following information:
Project Card 1:
Title: High-Availability Enterprise Network Design
Summary: Architected a fault-tolerant, three-tier hierarchical network for a simulated hospital, implementing redundant Layer 3 switching and first-hop redundancy to guarantee uptime for critical services.
Technologies Used (Display as tags/pills): Cisco Packet Tracer, Hierarchical Design, L3 Switching, HSRP, RSTP, EtherChannel
Buttons: "View on GitHub", "Read the Story"
Project Card 2:
Title: Secure Multi-Site WAN & Internet Edge
Summary: Designed and configured a multi-site enterprise network using dynamic routing (OSPF) and established a secure internet edge with an ACL-based firewall and Network Address Translation (NAT).
Technologies Used (Display as tags/pills): Cisco Packet Tracer, OSPF, WAN, ACLs, Firewall, NAT
Buttons: "View on GitHub", "Read the Story"
Project Card 3:
Title: Network Reconnaissance & Vulnerability Identification
Summary: Conducted hands-on security analysis using industry-standard tools to perform host discovery, port scanning, and service enumeration to identify a target network's attack surface from an attacker's perspective.
Technologies Used (Display as tags/pills): Nmap, Wireshark, Netcat, Vulnerability Assessment
Buttons: "View on GitHub", "Read the Story"
Functionality: Link the "View on GitHub" buttons for all projects to https://github.com/sammyweru.
E. Contact Section:
Section Title: Get In Touch
Social Links:
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Do NOT display raw text links. Use clean, modern ICONS for LinkedIn, GitHub, and X (Twitter).
The icons must be clickable and open the corresponding links in a new browser tab.
LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/in/samuelchegewaweru
GitHub: https://github.com/sammyweru
X: https://x.com/cyberwithchege
Contact Form:
Create a contact form with fields for "Name", "Email", and "Message".
SECURITY BEST PRACTICES (MANDATORY): The website's security is paramount. The contact form must NOT use a simple mailto: action. It must submit data to a secure backend function (like a Replit Autoscale Deployment). Implement both client-side and server-side validation and sanitization for all inputs to prevent XSS, injection, and other attacks. The function should securely forward the message to this email: chegesam68@gmail.com.
F. Footer:
Create a simple, clean footer containing: "© 2025 Samuel Chege Waweru. All Rights Reserved."
